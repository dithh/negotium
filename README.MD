About
This is my first attempt to build an REST API using node.js and express.
In the future i would like to add test cases using mocha and front end client  with Vanilla.js or Vue.

How to launch project : 

1)Make sure you have MongoDB and Node installed.
2)Run npm install to install all the packages i`ve been using.
3)Launch mongod.exe passing your local db address as --dbpath.
4)You can now make requests to the API and work with the database.
